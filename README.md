**Customer Churn Prediction**

**Project Overview:**

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a business using machine learning techniques. Customer churn, or customer attrition, is a critical metric for businesses, as it indicates the rate at which customers stop doing business with the company. By predicting churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve overall customer satisfaction.

**Dataset:**

The dataset used in this project contains information about customers, including their demographics, services they subscribed to, and whether they churned or not. The dataset required preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and balancing the dataset due to class imbalance.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

EDA was performed to understand the relationships between various features and customer churn. The analysis revealed insights such as the impact of different services, contract types, and pricing on churn rates.

**Machine Learning Models:**

Several machine learning models were evaluated for predicting customer churn, including XGBoost Classifier, Keras Neural Network, Simple RNN, and LSTM. These models were trained and tested using the preprocessed dataset, and their performance was evaluated based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Results:**

The LSTM model emerged as the best-performing model, with an accuracy of 0.84 and a ROC-AUC score of 0.9241. This model demonstrated balanced performance across all evaluation metrics and was selected as the final model for predicting customer churn.

**Conclusion:**

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to predict customer churn, providing valuable insights for businesses to improve customer retention strategies and enhance overall customer satisfaction.
